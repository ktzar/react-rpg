# Battle Simulator

Code based on React Webpack Typescript Starter

## Implementation notes
As I've already spent 2 hours on this I feel I should stop now, but if given more time I'd like to do more tests and general polish.

I've decided to use two types of state management (useReducer and useState) to show both approaches. I would've normally used redux but I felt I'd spend too much time setting it up since I didn't find a boilerplate repo I was happy with.

## Installation
1. Clone/download repo
2. `yarn install` (or `npm install` for npm)

## Usage
**Development**

`yarn run start-dev`

* Build app continuously (HMR enabled)
* App served @ `http://localhost:8080`
